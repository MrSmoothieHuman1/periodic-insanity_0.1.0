  pick up your steel axe, and paint the factory RED:

  Additions:
    - Created hell. cannot unmake.
    - Added hematite, chalcocite, violarite and sphalerite as the starter ores, instead of chunks - which are 4:1 ratio with their plates.

  Changes:
    - Changed circuit boards to be exponential. Orange boards take 4 green, red boards take 8 orange, blue boards take 16 red, etc
    - Changed circuit board molding to also be exponential, but be one iteration behind normal boards.
    - Lowered amount of module slots furnaces have, and gave them an electric drain which makes up half their power demand. Electric 1's have 5 slots, electric 2's have 8 slots, heat furnaces have 6 slots.
